                - Express
                - HTML5
                - CSS
                - JavaScript

## Details: 

Upon loading, users are directed to sign up or sign. New users sign up,and are added to the users list, and automatically logged in and authenticated. They are then directed to a survey page to allow proper matching. Upon submitting the survey, the user's matches are displayed. Users who have already signed up are able to login using the login page, which then directs them to their matches upon successful login. From the matches page, each user can select a potential gym buddy, and routed to the selected profile. The user can look at previous reviews for the user in question to validate whether or not this particular person would be a good gym partner.

## Potential Future Improvements: 
        1. Improve matching algorithm based on user input or focus group studies.
        2. Implement location matching for users.
        3. Develop sport specific matching: EX: to set up tennis matches, golf, basketball games, etc...
        4. Add blocking mechanisms so users can block others who are acting inappropriately.
        5. Add in app messaging.
        6. Add workout trackers, stop watches, rep counters, etc... to make the app a one stop shop for fitness.
        7. Implement better and more comprehensive error checking for the input fields.
